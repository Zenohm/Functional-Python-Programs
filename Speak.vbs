speaks="The plot thickens! Thank to you guys who reviewed.   You keep my morale up.   No really, you do.   Im not depressed or anything, you just keep giving me a reason to write.   Please dont send me happy pills.   Unless they really have happy faces on them.   Then I would just collect them.   Anyway, let the show begin!Chapter 6: Crimson ShadowsKlenn une lazily opened his eyes.   His vision was blurred to the point that he can barely make out a shape.   He struggled to move his arms but something was restraining him to something else.   His breathing became erratic and his head was pounding.   Sudddenly he could hear what sounded like voices.   He saw two shadowy masses float towards him.  And he managed to get that far?Yes, we were able to secure him though.  Did he learn anything about.  .  .  I wont have this project compromised.  He knows nothing.  .  .  -nd we made sure that the data was secured.  What do the.  .  .  -ay?His vitals are im-.  .  .  -est subject.  He has.  .  .  ? You are cor-.  .  .  ct.  It was the.  .  .  a.  Whether you.  .  .  up to you, captain.   Just make sure he.  .  .  Yes, Unti.  .  .  I have to get to.  .  .  -day.   Toss him in the cells once youre.  .  .  Of course, Untia.  .  .  .  patrols every hour on the hour.  One of the shadowy masses left the room, leaving the other behind.   Klenn une tried to speak, but he was so incapacitated that all that came out was a incoherent sentence.   The mass seemed to float towards him and slapped him.  .  .  .  -ry special suprise for you.   the mass said.   Klenn une was suddenly shocked from seemingly nowhere.   His whole body shook violently and he screamed in pain.  Hurts doesnt.  .  .  ? the mass said in a sinister tone.   Klenn une was shocked again, more intensely than before.   His head began to drop; his strength was being sapped by every shock.   He was shocked once more, it was the most painful feeling Klenn une had ever felt.   He body convulsed unnarturally.   Klenn une began coughing up blood, landing on his visor and streaming down it.   Klenn unes vision was blacking out, he was close to passing out again.  Dont worry.  .  .  be over soon.   the mass said in a menacing tone.   Klenn une almost spoke, but the intense pain he felt stopped any attempt of doing so.   The mass moved away from him and pressed something on the wall.   Klenn une suddenly felt a sharp pain in his arm.   He saw a large tube being filled with his blood.   He started to shake even more.   He was then shocked again.   Screaming from the intense pain.  The mass picked up a datapad and read it.  Kle.  .  .  Onara, huh? You wont be.  .  .  et any more.   the mass said.   He was shocked again and coughed up more blood.   The door slid open and two more figures entered the room.  Take.  .  .  cells.   Put him.  .  .  o.   the mass ordered.   The two figures floated towards Klenn une and began removing the restriants.   As soon as the were removed, Klenn une fell to the floor; lacking any strength to ever try to get up.   He was picked up by his arms and dragged out of the room.   Klenn une coughed up a few more drops of blood.   He was in horrible condition.   He once more tried to resist.   It only provoked one of the figures to kick him in the helmet.   Not having even the slighest idea of what to do, Klenn une intentionally let himself black out; hoping that when he woke up, it would turn out to be a horrible dream.  .  .  .  A three-fingered hand lightly tapped on Klenn unes visor.   It had attempted to wake him for several hours, but ended with no results.  Come on, kid.   Youre not done yet.   a voice said.   Klenn une lay motionless and unresponsive to the persons attempts to wake him.   The person grabbed Klenn une and dragged him to a wall.   Propping his upper body against the wall, he tried one more to waken him.  Hey, quarian, you all right in there? it asked.   The same three-fingered hand reached down and pinched Klenn unes wrist.   His eyes immediatly opened and he made a sudden spasm.   Klenn unes vision finally cleared and he was able to make out who woke him up.   In front of him was a turian wearing all gray and he bore no facial markings.   He also noticed the dry stains of blood on his visor.  Great, thats going to be hard to clean up.  You know, Ive had enough pain for one day.   Id really appreciate it if you didnt do that again.   Klenn une muttered.  Had to do something to wake you up.   Besides, it was kind of funny seeing you spaz out like that.   the turian chuckled.  Forget what I said, Id really appreciate if you didnt talk to me.   Klenn une corrected himself.  Oh come on now.   That anyway to treat your new roommate? the turian said.  Roommate? What are you talking about? Klenn une said.  In case you havent noticed, were in a nice cold cell.   An enjoyable slice of paradise if you ask me.   the turian said.   Klenn une tried to pull himself to his feet, but the turian stopped him.  You dont wanna move around just yet.   From what I could tell, youre in pretty bad shape.   the turian said.  It doesnt matter.   Im trained to resist pain.   Klenn une objected.   He pulled himself to his feet, letting out a small grunt.  You sound so full of yourself, you know that? the turian joked.  Hey, every man has his ego.   Klenn une said.  And some men know when the right time to show said ego is.   the turian replied.   Klenn une glared at the turian for a while then changed the subject.  So, who are you? Klenn une asked.  Where are my manners, my name is Rekko Privien.   Rekko said.   And what might yours be? Calling you quarian was getting a little stale.  And now begins the small talk in a cramped cell on a base on an unknown world.   Eh, might aswell humor him.  Klenn uneLehto.   he simply replied.  Well as long as were here, might aswell start getting to know each other.   So what are you in for? Rekko asked.  I stuck my nose somewhere it didnt belong.   You? Klenn une asked.  My wife cheated on me.   I killed the guy she was cheating with.   Heh, turned out to be one of these guys.   Rekko answered.  Great, Im locked in a cell with a murderer.  Id love to stay and chat, Rekko, but I need to get out of here.   Klenn une said whil scanning the cell.   It was an eight by eight foot cell with a barrier curtain blocking the exit.   As far as Klenn une could see, there was no obvious way of getting out.  Unless you havent noticed, Klenn une, there is no way of getting out of here.   Rekko said.  Every cell has at least two exits.   One is less obvious than the other.   Klenn une replied.   He looked out the barrier curtain and only saw a desk against the far wall.  Do you know anything about the guys who imprisoned us? Klenn une asked while looking out the barrier curtain.   A thought had come to his mind.   Maybe hed be able to use his little key, but he soon dismissed it when he realized there was nowhere suitable to use it.  Youd expect them to keep quiet about everything, but they sure love to talk right in front of me.   Rekko said with a presence of pride in his voice.  They call themselves the Crimson Shadows.   Some sort of secret organization.   Work for a person named Untia.   Dont know who that is and dont know what theyre doing here.   Rekko listed.  They were working on something called Project: Aperax.   I have no idea what its about.   Klenn une said.  Project: Aperax, huh? Ive never heard anything about that.   Rekko said with wonderment in his voice.  It was on a C-Sec terminal.   Do these guys work for them? Klenn une asked himself.  Dont think so.   These guys have been playing by their own set of rules.   And C-Sec is big on the whole protocols and regulations thing.   Rekko said.  Then why was the projects file on one of their terminals? Klenn une asked as if Rekko knew the answer.  Theyre a secret organization.   Someone was probably going to pick up that file you find.   Guess you got to it first.   Rekko said.  I didnt.   They took me prisoner before I could even lay a finger on the file.   As far as I know, they have it now.   Klenn une replied.  Well then I guess theyll continue with their plan.   Nothings going to stop it.   Rekko said.   Klenn une shook his head.   He didnt want these bastards to continue with whatever they were doing; especially if it required experimenting on quarians.   But his duty as a Migrant Fleet Marine came before anything else.   He had to find Arenia first, then worry about other things.  Well none of that matters now.   Whats important is that we get out of this hellhole before any of those guys come back.   Klenn une said.  Theres not a way out of here.   Ive checked! Rekko said.   Klenn une looked back at him then noticed something between his legs.   A small vent.  What about that? Klenn une said while pointing at the vent.   Rekko looked behind himself and saw the thing Klenn une was pointing at.  You really expect that to be the answer to our problems? Its bolted shut.   Rekko said with skepticism.   Klenn une walked over to the small vent and kneeled down.   Rekko was right, it was bolted shut with titanium screws from Klenn unes observation.   He patted his collarbone and felt a small tool.   CS dont check for equipment good enough.   Klenn une pulled out a small drill and began unscrewing the bolts.  Watch my back, they catch us trying to break out.  .  .  I really dont wanna think about it.   Klenn une said.  Right.   The CS arent really the best hosts.   Rekko agreed.   He walked over to the barrier curtain and began scanning for any CS entering the room.   Klenn une quickly removed the bolts and pulled off the vents grate.   He peered inside the dark vent.   It was just big enough for a salarian.  .  .  or a clever quarian.  Im going in.   Ill find a way back here and open the barrier.   Klenn une said.  Yeah, just hurry.   Id rather not be the only one to blame for this.   Rekko said uneasily.   Klenn une quickly crawled into the vent and disappeared.   As soon as Klenn une left, the entrance to the cell block opened, a lone CS agent walked in.   He looked straight at Rekko and gave an evil grin.   He casually walked over to Rekko and crossed his arms.  Arent you exicted, Rekko? You get to contribute to a very important cause.   Too bad you wont live to see it.   the CS agent said.  At least I wouldnt have to listen to you everyday, James.   Rekko replied.  Well guess what? James said.  Oh, how I hate guessing games.   Rekko said.  Im going to be the one to send you on your way.   My voice will be the last you hear.   James sneered.   There was suddenly a quiet thump which told Rekko Klenn une was getting close.   Rekko seperated his mandibles, the turian version of smiling.  Such a thing would be a fate worse than hell.   Rekko said.  Im going to miss that smart-ass attitude of yours, Rekko.   James said.  You are? Aww, you do care.   Rekko replied.   A vent grate suddenly fell from the ceiling.   Luckily, James didnt hear it.   Rekko could see the faintly glowing dots that were Klenn unes eyes.   Klenn une jumped from the vent and landed on the floor with a small grunt.   He still hadnt recovered from the CS torture.   He turned around and saw James being distracted by Rekko.  He then noticed something else.   Next to his cell was another one that had an asari and a salarian inside it.   He put his finger in front of his helmets light, the universal sign of be quiet.   The salarian pointed at the desk behind Klenn une.   He turned around and saw his knife and sheath on the desk.   He awkwardly limped over to the desk and grabbed his knife, he then turned around and quietly limped behind James.  Its been a long time coming.   Youve been in there for a good amount of time and it all ends so soon.   James said.  You are so right.   Rekko agreed.   James didnt know that Rekko meant something entirely different from what he said.   Klenn une grabbed James from behind and swiftly slit his throat.   Klenn une grabbed the dying agent to stop any loud thud from his landing.  F-Fucker.   James gurgled.   Klenn une lightly placed the body on the floor.  Bastard until the end, huh, James? Rekko said.  You two seemed to have a past.   Klenn une said.  The guy always harassed me when I got stuck in here.   Now that hes lying in a pool of his own blood, hes no longer a nuiscence.   Open up the gate.   Rekko said.   Klenn une walked to the control panel on the side of the barrier and lowered the curtain.   Rekko walked out and streched as if he had been cramped in the cell for a long time.  Hey, theres more prisoners over here.   Klenn une said, motioning his head in their direction.   The two ran over to the other cell and stopped in front of the asari and salarian.   The salarian gave a friendly wave.  Think we should let them out? Klenn une whispered.   Rekko rubbed his gray, brown face.  I guess we should, we could use the extra help to get out of here, but well need to be careful.   Rekko said.  Were letting you out, but you better not try anything.   Klenn une warned.   The two nodded their heads in agreement.   Klenn une deactivated the fields and the asari and salarian walked out.   Klenn une quickly began searching for any signs of deception.  The asari wore a pink dress and had facial markings that told Klenn une that she was either in her late maiden stage or early matron stage.   The salarian had brown-red skin and wore a green casual outfit with a green jacket.  Im Tara, this is Darin.   the asari said.   Thanks for getting us out of there, I hate being cooped up in one place for too long.  Im Klenn une.   This is Rekko.   We were thinking of busting out of here.   You two want in? Klenn une asked.  Im not one to deny a good fight.   Tara said.  Hopefully we can sneak out of here before it comes to that.   Rekko said.  You dont know how to have fun then.   Anyways, anybody have an idea on how to get out of here? Tara asked.  Well since we all have a common hatred of CS, we can either be quiet about it or shoot our way out.   Either way, the only way any of us are getting out of here alive is if we work together.   Rekko said.  Cant take all of them all alone.   Rekkos right, we work together, we have a fighting chance of getting out of here.   Klenn une said.   Does anyone know where to find any weapons?I managed to hide a few.   These idiots dont know how to weapons check.   Tara said.   Darin pulled out two Raikou Vs and tossed one of them to Tara.   Rekko walked over to James corpse and grabbed his sidearm, a Razer IV.  And the quarian is left without a gun.   How dreadful.   Klenn une said.  You have a knife.   And you know how to use it.   Youll be fine.   Rekko said.  Dont just assume that kind of stuff, Rekko.   Dont worry, Klenn une.   Well watch your back.   Tara assured.  Thanks, Tara.   Nice to know some- Klenn une started but was interrupted by a hail of gunfire.   The whole group hid inside the nearest cell.   Tara, Darin, and Rekko all returned fire.   Klenn une opened his palm and tried once more to create a mass effect field.   One was formed in his hand successfully.  Yes, thank you keelah.  Klenn une turned the corner and fired a warp and the nearest CS, hitting his chest and making blood spout out from it.  Well look whos got a special talent.   And you said you needed a gun.   Rekko said.  Theres nothing wrong with a little more firepower.   Klenn une replied.   The group continued to fire back at the CS.   Tara would use her own biotics from time to time and Darin would throw what little tech mines he had.   Klenn une decided to do a more bold move.  Guys, cover me! he said.   He immediatly dashed out from the cell and sprinted to the desk.   Closing in at a few meters, Klenn une slid the rest of the way to the desk.   Now that he was closer to the CS, he would be able to use his biotics more accurately.   Tara soon followed him, sliding to the desk.  There isnt anymore room, guys.   Stay where you are.   she shouted over the gunfire.  Got it.   Rekko said.   Tara then turned to Klenn une.  Just how good are you with your biotics? she asked.  Good enough to kill several people at once.   Klenn une responded.  Okay then, there are four CS.   All of them are taking cover in the hallway outside.   Any ideas? Tara asked.  Just one.   We just need to wait until one of them sticks their head out.   Klenn une said.   The two peered out from cover to watch for anyone popping out of cover.   After a couple of seconds, the opportunity presented iteself.   As soon as one of the CS popped out, Klenn une lifted him into the air and catapulted the agent towards him.   Klenn une quickly pulled out his knife and stabbed the agent in the neck when he got close.   Klenn une grabbed the body and held it as a meat shield.  Tara, give me your pistol! Klenn une said.   Tara obliged and threw him the pistol.   Klenn une grabbed it and slowly made his way towards the door.   Every shot that was fired landed on Klenn unes meat shield.   He moved closer and closer to the door, his meat shield taking more and more shots.  What the hell is he doing? Rekko questioned.  Being a badass apparently Tara answered.   Once Klenn une reached the door, he fired a singularity into the hall.   All four CS were caught.   Klenn une threw the body to the floor and motioned for everyone to fire.   Rekko and Darin all fired at the CS.   Eventually the singularity ended, but one of the agents were still alive.   He landed on his knees and, unexpectedly, vomited.  Cute.   Tara commented.   Darin walked up to the sick agent and and waved a goodbye.   He then stomped on the agents head, crushing his skull.   Klenn une was not expecting such brutahliety from a salarian.   But in a situation like this, it was demanded.   Klenn une tossed his pistol back to Tara and brandished his knife.   The group assembled out the hallway and looked around.   The hallway stretched out from both sides.  Which way do we go? Rekko asked.   The bases alarms suddenly blared, alerting all personnel to the escaped prisoners.  We better pick fast.   Tara said.  Wanna flip a chit? Klenn une suggested.   Darin immediatly reached into his pocket and grabbed a chit.   He flipped it into the air and grabbed it.   He put it back into his pocket and pointed to the right.  Ooookay, I didnt mean it but sure, lets go that way.   Klenn une said, amused that the salarian took him literally.  I dont know if I wanna put my life on a chit.   Rekko said.  Well then youre more than welcome to go back to your cell while we kill everyone.   Klenn une joked.  Youve been in there longer than any of us.   A few more minutes wont kill you.   Tara added.  Hehe, no I uhh.  .  .  Id rather not.   Rekko said uneasily.  Then to the right it is.   Klenn une said and ran with everyone following him.   They all broke into a full sprint.  Theres a large door ahead, must be the entrance to the hangar.   Klenn une said.  How convinient.   Rekko said.   A door in front of them suddenly opened and a CS agent walked out.   Before he could level his gun to fire, he was thrown to the ground by Tara.   Klenn une jumped on him and stabbed him in the temple.   Instanly killing him.   Klenn une couldnt afford to waste any time with the CS.   He catched up with the group and made it to the door.   He tried to open it but it wouldnt budge.  Perfect.   Klenn une said sarcastically.  Darin, open the door.   Well cover you.   Tara said.   Darin nodded and moved to the door and began hacking into it.  Incoming CS! Rekko shouted.   Everyon turned around and saw three CS running towards them.   Darin tossed his pistol to Klenn une and continued hacking the door.   All three fired at the charging CS.   The agents hid behind the nearby door and returned fire.  Tara, can you pull one of those guys out of cover? Klenn une asked.  I cant get a good angle! Tara replied.  Then we do it the hard way.   Klenn une said.   He crouched down and slowed his breathing.   He carefully pointed the sights down the door.   A head popped out to fire and was immediatly shot in the forehead by Klenn une.   One of the CS agents threw a flashbang grenade in front of Klenn une.   He immediatly polarized his visor to full opacity.   All that showed was a small white dot.   De-polarizing it, he aimed once more and fired two rounds.   Only one hit their mark.   The wounded CS fell to the floor, holding his knee.   Rekko fired and made a perfect shot to the temple.   The last CS dropped his gun and began to run from the group.   Tara pulled him towards the group.   She calmly walked over to the floating CS and snapped his neck.  Darin, hows the door coming? She asked.   Darin turned around and gave a thumbs up.   The group massed at the door and got ready for whatever was behind it.  Everyone be ready.   Dont know whats behind this door.   Klenn une warned.   Everone nodded and aimed the pistols at the doors.   A thought immediatly came to Klenn une and he turned around.   He walked over to the dead CS agents and grabbed their assault rifles.   He put one on his back and tossed the other two to Tara and Rekko.   They checked their weapons and aimed them at the door.   Klenn une cautiously opened the door and the group stormed in.   They were only able to get two steps in when everyone stopped.   The entire group drooped their guns and held up their hands.  In front of them were at least thirty CS agents, all aiming their guns and the groups heads.   There was no way they could walk out guns blazing.  Well shit.   Rekko muuttered.  Shouldve seen this coming.   Tara said.   Darin nodded in response.  Keep cool, guys.   We might have a chance.   Klenn une said.   he looked around and saw stacks of crates on both sides of the doors.   He carefully inched his way to of them.  Dont even think about it, quarian.   a voice said.   Klenn une recognized it.   He looked up and saw the same asari who had drugged him and probably totured him walk through her soldiers.   She calmly walked over and stopped in front of all the CS agents.   She pulled out a cigarette and lit it.   She took a puff and made a face that showed a hint of irritation.  I should have killed you when I had the chance.   she said.  People tend to make that mistake.   Klenn une said, walking away from his group and stopping a few meters from the asari.   She took another puff and smilied a sinister grin.  Dont even think for a second that youre going to get out of here.   Youll be pelted with lead before you even make a move.   she said.  Whether you believe me or not, I am going to leave.   Along with these guys.   And were going to expose whatever this Project: Aperax is.   Klenn une said.   She laughed in response.  Do you honestly think that you can expose us? Face it kid, youll never know what Project: Aperax is.   Or what it will be.   And if you think you can escape, then youre a fool.   she laughed.  Ive faced worse.   Klenn une replied.  Ill bet.   the asari said.   She dropped her cigarette on the floor and stepped on it.  If you think you can take on thirty of my best men, then youre welcome to try.   Goodbye, quarian.   I was going to save you for the project, but using you as target practice will have to do.   she said.   The asari turned around and began to walk away.  Why dont you stay and fight? Klenn une said.   The asari stopped and turned her upper body around.   She saw Klenn une slowly walking towards her, taking off his knife and guns.  Just you and me.   No knives, no guns.   Only fists and biotics.   Come on, asari.   Why dont you show me what you got.   Klenn une challanged.   The asari turned completely around and smilied the same sinister grin.   She walked towards Klenn une, taking off her shotgun, assault rifle, and sniper.   She then removed her belt that had several tech mines.  Your move, quarian.   But you dont know what youre getting yourself into.   the asari said.   The two started to circle each other, just waiting for the other to make a move.   Rekko, Tara, and Darin all lowered their hands and slowly reached for their guns.  Everyone get ready.   We dont know how this is going to play out.   Tara said.   Klenn une and the asari continued to ciracle each other, their arms glowing blue with biotic energy.   The asari suddenly stopped.  If were going to do this, we need to do it alone.   she said.   Klenn une raised a brow as to what she meant.   He was suddenly lifted into the air by the asari and thrown up to an elevated repair platform.  Finish off his friends.   Ill deal with him personally.   the asari ordered.   The group had moved to the crates and soon as the asari finished her sentence.   They were immediatly shot at by the CS agents.   The asari moved to a ladder and climbed to the top of the platform.   Klenn une was already waiting for her when she reached to top, glowing the in the blue aura of biotics.   The asari did the same.  Its over, quarian.   You cant possibly hope to beat me.   the asari said.  Its not over.   Its only just begun.  Showdown thy name is Ferret.  "
